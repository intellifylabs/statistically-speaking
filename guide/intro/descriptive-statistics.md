# Unveiling patterns with descriptive statistics

After gaining a broad understanding of what statistics entails, let's delve into a special category called **Descriptive Statistics**. Here, we aim to describe and summarize the main features of our dino dataset.

## Measures of Central Tendency

Let's go back to our dataset with the heights, weights, and ages of various dinos. One of the first things we might want to know is what the "typical" values are for these attributes.

### Mean (Average)

We’ve already touched on this! The mean is the sum of all the values divided by the number of values. For example, if we have the heights of five dinos (2, 3, 10, 11, 12 meters), the mean would be (2 + 3 + 10 + 11 + 12)/5 = 38/5 = 7.6 meters.

### Median

The median is the middle value when the data set is ordered from least to greatest. In our example, if we arrange the heights (2, 3, 10, 11, 12), the median is 10.

### Mode

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. If we had another dataset with ages of dinos (2, 3, 3, 11, 12), the mode would be 3, as it occurs twice.

## Measures of Spread

We also want to know how diverse the dinos are in their heights, weights, and ages.

### Range

The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. In our first dataset (2, 3, 10, 11, 12), the range of heights is 12 - 2 = 10 meters.

### Variance and Standard Deviation

We talked about the standard deviation in the last chapter. It’s rooted in variance. Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. They both tell us about the spread of the data. High variance or standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out from the mean, and low values indicate they are close to the mean.

## Visualizing Data with Graphs

Graphs can be an excellent way to see what’s going on in a dataset.

### Histograms

Histograms are useful for understanding the distribution of the data points. They can help you see if the data is normally distributed, or if there are any outliers.

### Box Plots

Box plots show the range of the data, along with the median, and can also help you spot outliers.

## Conclusion

Descriptive statistics is the foundation of understanding data. By calculating measures of central tendency and spread, and visualizing the data, we can reveal patterns and insights that might not be apparent at first glance. It’s like our dino friends looking through a magnifying glass, discovering the amazing stories hidden within the numbers!
